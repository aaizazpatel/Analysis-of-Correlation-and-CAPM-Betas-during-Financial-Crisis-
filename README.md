# Project: Analysis of Correlation and CAPM Betas during Financial Crisis README

## Introduction

This repository contains code and analysis for Project 2 of FINA 6333 â€“ Spring 2024 course taught by Richard Herron. The project aims to investigate whether correlations tend to converge during financial crises and if there's a similar pattern for Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) betas. The analysis utilizes daily returns data for S&P 500 stocks from 1980 through 2023.

## Group Members

This project was completed as a group effort by the following members:
- Aaizaz Patel
- Sumukh Sai
- Harshita Bhambhani
- Sumit Sharma
- Fidan Afandiyeva

## Files

- `Analysis of Correlation and CAPM Betas during Financial Crisis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Data

The data used for this analysis includes daily returns for current stocks in the S&P 500 index (^GSPC) and the daily close of the S&P 500 index from 1980 through 2023. The data was retrieved using the yfinance package.

## Analysis

The analysis involves calculating correlations between stock returns during normal periods and during crises, as well as computing CAPM betas for stocks under similar conditions. Various measures of market performance, such as drawdowns and recent runups, are considered to identify crises.

## Instructions

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system.
2. Download the `Analysis of Correlation and CAPM Betas during Financial Crisis.ipynb` notebook and `sp500.csv`(Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hDyILt2I70sUMDjPd3ORYz3Iy_mc06rr/view?usp=drive_link) data file.
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run all cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate results.

## Conclusion

The findings of this analysis will help understand whether correlations tend to increase during financial crises and if there's a similar pattern for CAPM betas. Any weaknesses in the analysis are also discussed along with possible solutions.
